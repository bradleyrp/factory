  STEP 1: getting started
    To use this code, copy this yaml file and customize for your account.
    Build a virtualenv with yaml:
      python=python3 make venv create file=specs/env_venv.txt  
    Next, get a copy of the image file below.
    Then create a tmpdir on a fast filesystem.
    To try it out, set live to true below and use "bc-test-v01" as the name.
    Execute in an interactive session with:
      rm -f container-spack-hpc.sh && make do specs/spack_hpc_go.yaml
    This puts you inside a container and runs concretize.
    More detail coming soon.
